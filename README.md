# GameConsoleDemo

Basic C#/.NET web application to demostrate basic concepts of building and developing a web app using C#/.NET using Razor web pages

This applcation RUNS ON A LOCAL HOST ONLY as it's just a demostration of self learning to prove concepts of development and reinforce learning. The learning done was the effective use of the Visual Studio 2019 IDE. Coding Models using C# (transferring skills learned in Java and getting used to the C# syntax), developing Controllers for data loading onto a webpage View (which is done using Razor).

Will plan to add unit testing such as jQuery to also transfer software testing knowledge from a Java environment to a C#/.NET environment
